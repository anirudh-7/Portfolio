  description: "Hey there, I'm Anirudh! I’m that developer who gets unreasonably excited about clean code and somehow ends up debugging until the kind of hours only owls understand. If I’m not chasing the perfect solution, I’m probably tinkering with the latest shiny piece of tech that derailed my sleep schedule.",
  description2: "My learning style? Jump in headfirst, break things gloriously, and put them back together better than before. (Currently applying that same philosophy to learning tennis footwork — it’s going about as well as my first attempt at Kubernetes.)",
  description3: "My superpower? Making complex systems look so simple your grandmother could use them with confidence. And yes, I’m one of those rare developers who actually writes good documentation. Think of it like flossing: everyone says they do it, but I’m one of the few who really does.",
  description4: "I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can build meaningful tech, collaborate with smart humans, and work at a place that doesn’t mind the ocassional dad joke and sponsoring my visa. Let's create something awesome together!",
